# Make_Design_Interact
An Introduction to Interactive Technology


“Make Design Interact” is a foundation course created for a design program doing New Media and Communication, targeting at sophomore students who have already done some design foundation but with zero knowledge on “technology”.
For some unknown reason, designers, especially those who have had rich design experiences will regard technology, refers to programming and electronics, as fantastic magical and miserable methods can easily produce cool designs and artworks, but also feel it is extremely hard to learn and get started. And so do those young design students.
With all those concerns, “Make Design Interact” is made to build students confidence on hands-on technology including coding, electronics and fabrication, get them feel comfortable and enjoy making and prototyping, and also gain well understandings of interactive technology and design senses.
